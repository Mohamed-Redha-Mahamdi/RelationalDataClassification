# RelationalDataClassification
This repository showcases a machine learning project for classifying nodes in relational datasets (`Cora`, `CiteSeer`, `Pubmed`). It compares algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Neural Networks, evaluating performance using accuracy, F1-score, and NMI on structured graph data.
